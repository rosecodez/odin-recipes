    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>high-quality fettuccine</li>
            <li>high-fat cream</li>
            <li>salted butter</li>
            <li>nutmeg</li>
            <li>pecorino romano, asiago or grana padano</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by cooking one pound of Fettuccine pasta in a large pot of salted water until just underdone. It will finish cooking in the sauce, so it’s important not to overcook it. Reserve a half cup of the pasta cooking liquid before draining the pasta.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat 2 cups of heavy cream in a deep sauté pan over low-medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once heated, add eight tablespoons of butter along with one peeled garlic clove (optional) and whisk gently until melted.</li>
            <li>Mix in a pinch of nutmeg, followed by ¾ cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Season the sauce with freshly grated black pepper, and taste it before adding any additional salt. Keep in mind that Parmesan cheese can be quite salty on its own, so it’s best to avoid over-seasoning</li>
            <li>Simmer over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes to thicken the sauce. Then remove and discard the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta and parsley and toss gently to coat it in the Alfredo sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook until the pasta is al dente. If the sauce gets too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water a little at a time until it reaches your desired consistency. This water is full of flavor and velvety starch that thins out the sauce without diluting its flavor.</li>
            <li>Taste for seasoning and add salt to taste. Serve immediately and enjoy every last bite.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
